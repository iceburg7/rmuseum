The extension has been packed into the file rmuseum.crx.

- This extension moves the front page into an art gallery.
- The user can navigate away from the front page, and come back to the same place.
- The rightmost window contains the page that the user would be sent to upon clicking the link.

Errors and Omissions:
- Only the first 25 links will display
- There is not a way to go to specific subreddits
- Some websites block access from external sites, so they will not show up in the preview.
